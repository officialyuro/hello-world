# hello-world

Hello everyone!

"With two rich years in working experience, I have committed myself to making impact, and ensuring self-development. By practical experience, I have learnt the core strengths of effective leadership including integrity, strategy, team-spirit, and a pro-results orientation. As a career focus, I purpose to collaborate towards stimulating growth and the attainment of the corporate goals of my organization. I have interests in energy and aspire to join pioneering efforts at availing technologies to generate energy from renewable and reliable sources. I am also enthused by computer-based approaches to problem solving. Outside of work, I love to play chess and the piano, sing and read a variety of books."

...just as it is on LinkedIn.
